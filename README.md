# Bank Marketing

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that includes the deposit of money into an account at a financial institution. Term deposit investments usually carry short-term maturities ranging from one month to a few years and will have varying levels of required minimum deposits.

# Results
Using XGBoost, **2444 customers** were classified as accepting the term deposit. With a **recall of 81%** and an **accuracy of 88%.** Recall is how well the algorithm hits the positive class.
